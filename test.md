Paragraphs are separated
by a blank line.

produces a line break.

Here are some text attributes:

Inline _italic_ is supported.

Inline **bold** is also supported.

Inline `monospace`, also known as
`code`, is supported.

Additionally, inline ~~strikethrough~~ 
is supported.

Here is a horizontal rule:

Can you do an unordered list?

* Markdown is neat
* And typing things is easy
* But coming up with things to type

1. Why certainly!
2. This one is a little hacky
3. But it is working nonetheless!

Then a link:

Links can be [["inline" "https://github.com/swansonmp/mdconvert"]]!

And an image!

!(image.png)

And a video?

^(video.mp4)

And an audio file?

@(audio.mp3)

> I sure hope block-quotes are supported!

Inline <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> should
also be supported!

However, normal uses of `>` and `<` are preserved!  
`1 + 2 > 0`.

A table? You can do that?

+
Row 0 Col 0, Row 0 Col 1, Row 0 Col 2
Row 1 Col 0, Row 1 Col 1, Row 1 Col 2
Row 2 Col 0, Row 2 Col 1, Row 2 Col 2

Goodbye!
